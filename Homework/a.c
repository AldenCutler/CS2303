int main(void){

    // Assume that the machine you are working on implements floating point using 8 bits, following the IEEE Standard 754 representation. Further assume that the 8 bits are partitioned as follows: the most significant bit (MSB) is the sign bit, the next 4 bits are the exponent, and the final 3 bits are the fractional component. Evaluate the following bit patterns and provide your answer in decimal, use fractions when necessary (e.g. 2  7/8). Remember to show your work!

// 2. 210111010
