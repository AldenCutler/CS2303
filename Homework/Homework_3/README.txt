This program analyses past sales data for a coffee shop and summarizes it in three methods. First, it creates Total_sales.txt that contains
a list of each item and the total number of sales for the item. Second, the program creates Profits.txt that contains the total sales, total
cost, amount earned, and profit for each item. Lastly, the program creates Top_earners.txt which lists the top 10 items with the highest revenue. 

To run the program, first compile in the terminal by typing or copy/pasting: make
If this produces an error, that's normal. Instead, type: mingw32-make

Then, to run the executable, type: ./analysis.exe

This is my own work, except I looked up how 2d arrays work to better understand them (it wasn't excactly looking up documentation so I wasn't sure
if I needed to list that or not, I mainly just taught myself how they work).
