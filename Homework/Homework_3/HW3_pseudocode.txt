In analysis.c:
    allocate arrays to store 6 months of data
    initialize money and month_data to zeros
    loop over all months
        open sales file
        load sales data
        end loop
    load sales data into file
    call all three functions from functions.c

In functions.c:
    define ITEMS to be 51
    In get_totals(int[][7], int, int):
        initialize variables
        loop over all columns
            loop over all the rows
                add the number of items sold to the count
                print the item nubmer and the number of items sold to the file
        close the file.

    In get_profits(int[][7], int, int, float[][2]):
        initialize variables
        print the header of the file
        loop over all the columns  
            get the item number
            loop over all the rows 
                add the number of items sold to the count
            calculate the total cost of the item
            calculate the total revenue of the item
            print the item number, the number of items sold, the cost, the sales, and the profit to the file
        close the file

    In top_earner(int[][7], int, int, float[][2]):
        initialize variables
        print the header of the file
        loop through all items to calculate the revenue of each item
        get the item number
            get the total number of items sold
            calculate the revenue of that item
            store the item number and the total number of that item sold in the data array
        loop 10 times to print the top 10 Top_earners
            find the item with the highest revenue
            using the index of that item, get ther revenue of that item
            print the item number, total sales, and revenue of the item with the highest revenue to the file
            reset the revenue of the highest item to 0 so that it isn't printed more than once
        close the file
