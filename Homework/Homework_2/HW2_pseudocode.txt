In the file coffee_shop.c:
    in int main(void):
        initialize variables
        ask the user for input on which calculation to run
        store that value in a variable taskNum
        ask the user for an input file and store that value as fileName
        open the file given
        switch statement:
            depending on what the user input was (1, 2, or 3, otherwise we print "This option is not valid.")
            1: 
                call the function that calculates overall revenue from the other c file
                break;
            2: 
                call the function that calculates balance from the other c file
                break;
            3: 
                Ask which item the user wants to analyze and store that value as the item id
                call the function that calculates the total number of sales from the other c file
        return


In the file calculations.c:
    in float overall_revenue(FILE *f1):
        initialize variables
        loop through the entire input file:
            if the item ID number isn't 0 (meaning that line represents the sale of an item)
                then add the revenue from that sale to the total
        print the total revenue
        return revenue

    in float balance (FILE *f1):
        initialize variables
        very similiarly to overall_revenue, we loop through the entire input file, except this time we don't filter out the original balance   
            balance += price
        print total balance
        return

    in int tally(FILE *f1, int itemNum):
        initialize variables
        Ask user where the output should go and store the value
        Ask the user if they want to append the output to the end of the file or overwrite the given file, and store the decision
        loop through the entire input file and every time the item ID matches the given item number to look for, increase count by 1
            at the same time, also add the price of that item to a mounting total that will calculate the total revenue made from sales of that particular item
        If the user wanted to append the results to the end of the output file, then use fopen(outputFile, "a"), otherwise use fopen(outputFile, "w").
            If neither of those inputs were detected, print "Invalid input." and return 0.
        Write the results to the output file, then close and return count.
