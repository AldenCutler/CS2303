This program prompts the user to input a number representing one of three possible things to do and a file: 
1. Read the file and calculate the overall revenue for the day. Returns a float
2. Read the file and calculate the balance in the cash register at the end of the day. Returns a float.
3. Read the file and tally the nmuber of times a particular item was sold and the total revenue from that item. Returns an int. 

To run the program:
Step 1:
Type or copy/paste into the terminal: make
If this doesn't work, try this instead: mingw32-make

Step 2:
The first step should have created an executable file called sales.exe.
Now, type or copy/paste into the terminal: ./sales.exe
Then follow the prompts!

All of the code is my own work, but I looked up syntax for fprintf and fscanf to understand them.
